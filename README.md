Magic buttons project

With this project i wanted to create buttons that are simple but elegant in how they function upon hover and click. At first I was struggling with inspiration for how my buttons
should look and react but once I asked myself what I would want in a button the ideas started coming. I added slight quirks to give a seemingly insignificant tool just a touch of 
personality. After this project I have a new found respect for the button, such a overlooked function but its the small details that make an overall difference. 

At first I was moving really slowly and lacking motivation but once i realised I'm allowed to change the button content I was able to have some fun with it. I tried to match the 
action of the button with the intended use and I am happy with how it came out especially with the 'X' button how ever I would have liked to have it open to say exit once I hover
but I could'nt get it done.
